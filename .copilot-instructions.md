You are working on the Gmail Threat Analyzer project, a security-focused web application built with modern technologies.

## Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Analyze Gmail messages for security threats and vulnerabilities
- **Tech Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- **Focus**: Security analysis, user experience, and performance

## Key Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Prefer functional components and hooks over class components
- Use `type` imports for TypeScript types when possible
- Follow React best practices and patterns

### UI/UX
- Use shadcn/ui components consistently
- Follow Tailwind CSS utility-first approach
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Security Focus
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Handle sensitive data securely
- Consider privacy implications in all features
- Use secure coding practices

### File Organization
- Place UI components in `src/components/ui/` (shadcn/ui components)
- Place feature components in `src/components/analyzer/`
- Use `src/types/` for TypeScript definitions
- Place utilities in `src/utils/`
- Custom hooks go in `src/hooks/`

### Development
- Use the alias `@/` for src imports
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Test components before committing
- Use ESLint rules and fix warnings

## Common Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` - Add shadcn/ui components

Remember to maintain high security standards while building user-friendly interfaces for threat analysis.
